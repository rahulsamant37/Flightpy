# Flightpy

Flightpy is a travel agent API that helps users find flights and hotels, and send travel information via email. It uses various tools and APIs to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

## **Features**

- **Stateful Interactions**: The agent remembers user interactions and continues from where it left off, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Users have control over critical actions, like reviewing travel plans before emails are sent.
- **Dynamic LLM Usage**: The agent intelligently switches between different LLMs for various tasks, like tool invocation and email generation.
- **Email Automation**: Automatically generates and sends detailed travel plans to users via email.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rahulsamant37/Flightpy.git
    cd Flightpy
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:

#### Email Integration
The email integration is implemented using the **human-in-the-loop** feature, allowing you to stop the agent execution and return control back to the user, providing flexibility in managing the travel data before sending it via email.
